### Chat Application for Android

An implemenation of a chat application, connecting to SWAGGER DB, written in Java.

The app is composed of 5 intents/screens:
1) Login Page
2) Settings: Change theme (dark/light modes) and connection settings
3) Registration Page
4) Chats Page - Displaying your chats with other users
5) Chat Page - Your messages with a contact.

We implementated a local DB using Dao and Room, to minimize the requests to the DB server.

When receiving new message from a contact, you'll also be notified of the new message, using Firebase.
